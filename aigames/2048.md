# Introduction to 2048 Program Developed at CGI Lab

This page introduces the design of the 2048 program, developed in [Computer Games and Intelligence (CGI) Lab][cgi_lab], led by Professor [I-Chen Wu][icwu], at [Department of Computer Science][nctu_cs], National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan; and also acknowledges the contributors who are/were the members of the CGI lab.

### Achievements

- The first 2048 AI program reached 65536-tile. See the [replay](http://2048.aigames.nctu.edu.tw/2048/replay.php)

### Features

- Expectimax Tree Search.
- Variant of Temporal Difference Learning: Multi-Stage Temporal Difference Learning and TD-lambda.
- N-Tuple Networks: Features representation suggested by [Marcin Szubert's paper](http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/wjaskowski/pub/papers/Szubert2014_2048.pdf) on IEEE CIG 2014.
- The single-threaded program ran fast, about 500 moves per second.
