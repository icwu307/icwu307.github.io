<h1>Introduction to Go Programs Developed at CGI Lab</h1>
This page introduces the history of Go programs developed in <a href="http://www.aigames.nctu.edu.tw/">Computer Games and Intelligence (CGI) lab</a>, led by Professor <a href="http://java.csie.nctu.edu.tw/~icwu/">I-Chen Wu</a>, at <a href="http://www.cs.nctu.edu.tw/cswebsite/">Department of Computer Science</a>, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan; and also acknowledges the contributors who are/were the members of the CGI lab, unless specified explicitly.

<h2>HappyGo (2008-2011)</h2>
One year before 2008, Yung-Ler Wang (王永樂) wrote a simple version of Go program, named HappyGo, since his nickname was Happy. Although the program was completely rewritten after 2008 by the following authors, we still kept using the name HappyGo. 
<h3>Authors</h3>
	<table border="1">
		<tbody><tr>
			<td>Chun-Yi Chen (陳俊嶧)</td>
			<td>2008-2010</td>
			<td>Wrote most of the code of HappyGo, including Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and many heuristics.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Tsun-Tao Tso (左存道)</td>
			<td>2011-2012</td>
			<td>Wrote a solver inside HappyGo, including the design of relevance zones.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>I-Chen Wu (吳毅成)</td>
			<td>2008-2012</td>
			<td>Supervised the whole project.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody></table>
<h3>Features</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Mainly implemented Monte Carlo Tree Search and lots of heuristics from Go knowledge (designed manually, not based on any machine learning methods). The code for playouts was rule-based.</li>
		<li>Run in single thread only (surely without any distributed computing) and for Go 9x9 only.</li>
	</ul>

<div id="Amigo"></div>
<h2>Amigo (2012-2014)</h2>
Ting-Fu Liao rewrote the whole Go program that contains a general framework for parallel Monte Carlo Tree Search, which can be used for other games, like Chinese dark chess. For generality, the initial version of Amigo by Ting-Fu Liao contained not much Go-specific code, except that it followed the rule-based playouts of HappyGo partially.

<h2>CGI (2015-)</h2>
Since Amigo had name conflict with an old Go program, it was renamed to CGI Go Intelligence (abbr. CGI). The program was not changed until Ti-Rong Wu as well as some authors (see below) made significant changes in the Go side on top of the framework in 2015. So, CGI is usually referred to the changed version starting from 2015. 
<h3>Authors</h3>
	<table border="1">
		<tbody><tr>
			<td>Ti-Rong Wu (吳廸融)</td>
			<td>2015-current</td>
			<td>Made most significant changes and improvements over Amigo, mainly including the tuning of pattern features by machine learning method and many detailed work. (The key designer of the current CGI)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Guan-Wen Chen (陳冠文)</td>
			<td>2015-current</td>
			<td>Worked on distributed computing, handling server and worker synchronization.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Chung-Chin Shih (施仲晉)</td>
			<td>2015-current</td>
			<td>Assisted on the implementation of some patterns. To implement knowledges like life and death in Go, also used in KillAll Go.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Li-Cheng Lan (藍立呈)</td>
			<td>2015-current</td>
			<td>Assisted on MCTS including dynamic komi, argument tuning.</td>

<h3>Features</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Follow the framework of Amigo, but make a significant change as follows.</li>
		<li>Use machine learning skill to train lots of pattern feature, human made knowledge.</li>
		<li>Use some technique like progressive bias, progressive widening, dynamic komi to improve MCTS.</li>
