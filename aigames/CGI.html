<h2>HappyGo (2008-2011)</h2>
One year before 2008, Yung-Ler Wang (王永樂) wrote a simple version of Go program, named HappyGo, since his nickname was Happy. Although the program was completely rewritten after 2008 by the following authors, we still used the name HappyGo. Note that we focused on 9x9 Go in this version. 
<h3>Authors</h3>
	<table border="1">
		<tbody><tr>
			<td>Chun-Yi Chen (陳俊嶧)</td>
			<td>2008-2010</td>
			<td>Wrote most of the code of HappyGo, including Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and many heuristics.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Tsun-Tao Tso (左存道)</td>
			<td>2011-2012</td>
			<td>Wrote a solver inside HappyGo, including the design of relevance zones.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>

			<td>Supervised the whole project.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody></table>
<h3>Features</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Mainly implemented Monte Carlo Tree Search and lots of heuristics from Go knowledge (designed manually, not based on any machine learning methods). The code for playouts was rule-based.</li>
		<li>Run in single thread only (surely without any distributed computing) and for Go 9x9 only.</li>

<h2>Amigo (2012-2014)</h2>
Ting-Fu Liao rewrote the whole Go program that contains a general framework for parallel Monte Carlo Tree Search, which can be used for other games, like Chinese dark chess, NoGo. For generality, the initial version of Amigo by Ting-Fu Liao contained not much Go-specific code, except that it followed the rule-based playouts of HappyGo partially. Note that we still focused on 9x9 Go in this version, but it works for 19x19 due to generality (but very weak). So, we can say that 19x19 had not been developed in this stage.

<h2>CGI 1.0 (2015.1-2015.12)</h2>
Since Amigo had name conflict with an old Go program, it was renamed to <b>CGI Go Intelligence</b> (abbr. <b>CGI</b>, a kind of recursive acronym). The program was not changed until Ti-Rong Wu (the key developer) as well as some authors (see below) made significant changes in the Go side on top of the framework in 2015. So, CGI is usually referred to the changed version starting from 2015. Since some machine learning methods like M&M were incorporated, the program started working reasonably for 19x19 and the strength grows to 2d or so. 
<h3>Authors</h3>
	<table border="1">
		<tbody><tr>
			<td>Ti-Rong Wu (吳廸融)</td>
			<td>2015-current</td>

<h2>CGI 2.0 (2015.12-2016.8)</h2>
As of Dec 2015, we started incorporating Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) or so-called Deep Learning into CGI, which is called CGI 2.0 or Deep CGI for convenience. Here, we would like to thank and acknowledge Detlef Schmicker for sharing his DCNN data set (with 54% prediction rate), which was used as our initial DCNN data set, though we changed to our own training data in mid-Jan 2016. The following list simply shows the persons involved in this project and is subject to change (Note: Ti-Rong Wu, Li-Cheng Lan, and Guan-Wen Chen are three key developers in the current project).

<h2>CGI 3.0 (2016.8-)</h2>
As of Aug. 2016, we start the CGI 3.0 project, mainly developing value network (VN), and some other DCNNs, like RL policy network. 

As of Dec 2015, we started incorporating Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) or so-called Deep Learning into CGI, which is called CGI 2.0 or Deep CGI for convenience. This version is still being developed. Here, we would like to thank and acknowledge Detlef Schmicker for sharing his DCNN data set (with 54% prediction rate), which was used as our initial DCNN data set, though we changed to our own training data in mid-Jan 2016. The strength of this version grows significantly, but it is still unknown and not final yet, since the project is still ongoing now. The following list simply shows the persons involved in the Deep CGI project and is subject to change (Note: Ti-Rong Wu, Li-Cheng Lan, and Guan-Wen Chen are three key developers in the current project).
