<h1>Introduction to Chinese Dark Chess Program Developed at CGI Lab</h1>

This page introduces the history of Chinese dark chess program, DarkKnight, developed in <a href="http://www.aigames.nctu.edu.tw/">Computer Games and Intelligence (CGI) lab</a>, led by Professor <a href="http://java.csie.nctu.edu.tw/~icwu/">I-Chen Wu</a>, at <a href="http://www.cs.nctu.edu.tw/cswebsite/">Department of Computer Science</a>, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan; and also acknowledges the contributors who are/were the members of the CGI lab.

<h2>Early design of DarkKnight (2012-2013)</h2>
Wen-Jie Tseng (曾汶傑) wrote the whole Chinese dark chess program based on Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), when he served as a TA in the course, Theory of Computer Games, taught by Professor <a href="http://java.csie.nctu.edu.tw/~icwu/">I-Chen Wu</a> in 2012 fall. Note that the project of this course in 2012 was to write Chinese dark chess programs. He did not use much domain-specific knowledge except for using piece weights in playouts. He developed the program quickly by reusing part of his code for <a href="http://aigames.nctu.edu.tw/~icwu/games/Chimo.html">Chimo</a>, a Chinese chess program developed mainly by him in <a href="http://www.aigames.nctu.edu.tw/">CGI lab</a>.

<h3>Features</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Mainly implemented Monte Carlo Tree Search with few domain-specific knowledge, except for playouts which used capturing and escaping.</li>
		<li>Supported multi-threading.</li>
		<li>The program ran fast, about 30,000 simulations per second in a single thread for initial positions.</li>

<h2>More strength improvements for DarkKnight (2014-)</h2>
Based on the original DarkKnight, Chu-Hsuan Hsueh (薛筑軒) incorporated several techniques including early playout terminations, implicit minimax backups, quality-based rewards, and progressive bias to improve the playing strength. Besides, she also did some tunings for tournaments, e.g. time management, dealing with 180 plies to draw.

	</tbody></table>
<h3>Features</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Early playout terminations: Terminate a playout much earlier when it is very likely to win, lose, or draw.</li>
		<li>Implicit minimax backups: Guide MCTS selections by using minimax scores (from heuristic evaluations) of tree nodes together with the original simulated win rates.</li>
		<li>Quality-based rewards: Use simulation length and terminal state quality to adjust the rewards returning from simulations.</li>
		<li>Progressive bias: Guide MCTS selections by heuristic scores from domain-specific knowledge.</li>
